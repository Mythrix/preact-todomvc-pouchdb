# Preact TodoMVC - With real-time updates

A modified version of [katopz' preact-todomvc-pouchdb example project](https://github.com/katopz/preact-todomvc-pouchdb).

I used code from [PouchDB's own TodoMVC guide](https://pouchdb.com/getting-started.html) to make this project work properly with real-time updates. With this version, if you open the todo page in two browsers/browser sessions and make changes to the todo list, the edits will immediately be shown in the other browser session. (As long as you have a PouchDB server running and your demo page can connect to it properly.)

I hope the code is correct and not using any wrong understandings of Preact or PouchDB, I'm currently learning Preact and PouchDB from scratch myself, so I barely have any idea what I'm doing.
